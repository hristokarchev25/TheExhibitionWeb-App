    descriptionParahraph: 'Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.',
    descriptionParahraphTwo: 'Picasso\'s Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris.',
    descriptionParahraphThree: 'The Rose Period (1904–1906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso.'

    descriptionParahraph: 'Marie-Clémentine Valadon ( 23 September 1865 – 7 April 1938) was a French painter who was born at Bessines-sur-Gartempe, Haute-Vienne, France. In 1894, Valadon became the first woman painter admitted to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. She was also the mother of painter Maurice Utrillo. Valadon spent nearly 40 years of her life as an artist. The subjects of her drawings and paintings, such as Joy of Life (1911), included mostly female nudes, portraits of women, still lifes, and landscapes. She never attended the academy and was never confined within a set tradition or style of art.',
    descriptionParahraphTwo: 'Valadon\'s self-portraits, portraits, nudes, landscapes, and still lifes remain detached from trends and contemporaneous aspects of academic art. The subjects of Valadon\'s paintings often reinvent the old master themes: women bathing, reclining nudes, and interior scenes.',
    descriptionParahraphThree: 'Valadon emphasized the importance of the composition of her portraits over techniques such as painting expressive eyes. Her later works, such as Blue Room (1923), are brighter in color and show a new emphasis on decorative backgrounds and patterned materials.'

    image: joanImg,
    descriptionParahraph: 'Born in 1893, Joan Miró was a famous, Spanish Catalan artist. He did works in sculpture, painting, and worked as a ceramist. Born in the seaport city of Barcelona, much of his work was influenced by the scenic seaside town, and the distinct style that he found in thearea.  Miro\'s early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists exhibited in Barcelona, was inspired by works of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cezanne.',
    descriptionParahraphTwo: 'In 1919 Miro made his first trip to Paris, France, and thereafter he spent the winters in Paris and the summers in Montroig. His first one-man show in Paris was held in 1921 and his paintings of this period reflect cubist influences. His painting, Montroig, for example, has a frontal, geometric pattern greatly influenced by cubism.',
    descriptionParahraphThree: 'While he was in Paris, Joan Miró was introduced to Surrealism. Although Miro never joined the Surrealist circle, he collaborated with Max Ernst, one of leading Surrealist. In 1928, he exhibited with a group of renowned surrealist painters, including Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte in Paris; even though Surrealism has many influences in his work, Miro retained his own personal style, and distinct form in most of the works that he distributed and exhibited.'

    subtitle: '1937',
    image: guernicaImg,
    descriptionParahraph: 'Cubism, with its fractured forms and multifaceted perspectives, became the hallmark of Picasso’s genius. The artist’s fascination with breaking down and reassembling reality reached its zenith with “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” and later matured into the analytical and synthetic phases of Cubism.',
    descriptionParahraphTwo: '“Guernica.” Painted in the year 1937 as a response to the horrors of the Spanish Civil War, this colossal canvas stands as a testament to Picasso’s unwavering commitment to activism. Imagine the brush as a bullfighter’s cape, swirling through the air to expose the brutality of war. The dimensions in Guernica could house a mini-fiesta and the location. Madrid was the perfect stage for this artistic rebellion.'

export const farmObj = {
    id: 'farm',
    nameOfPage: 'The Farm',
    subtitle: '1921/1922',
    image: farmImg,
    descriptionParahraph: 'The Farm represents a brilliant amalgamation of an intense, even primitive realism with the formal vocabulary of cubism. The painting is a compendium of separate details, each carefully observed and precisely described. This detailed realism, however, is matched by a tendency to simplify forms into abstract, geometric shapes. Moreover, space in The Farm is defined by a ground plane that tilts sharply upward, while individual forms are similarly tilted, so that they sit silhouetted, parallel to the picture plane.',
    descriptionParahraphTwo: 'By the mid-1920s, Miró had abandoned the realist manner of The Farm and had created a surrealist style of automatism and abstraction. Elements from The Farm continued to appear in his work, however, and the intensity of vision found in this painting remained a standard for all of his later art.'

    image: adamEveImg,
    descriptionParahraph: 'This painting was made during a highly productive period for Valadon when she had just met the young André Utter. She had fallen in love again and as such felt a surge in creativity and began to paint rather than draw much more. The nearly life-sized painting depicts Valadon as Eve and Utter as Adam, the original lovers in the paradise of the Garden of Eden. The painting was originally completed without the leaves covering Utter’s genitals, but they were added later in order to avoid scandal and to enable exhibition of the work in the Salon of 1920.',
    descriptionParahraphTwo: 'This was the first painting in which Valadon placed her subjects in an outdoor rather than interior setting. It was also the first painting exhibited by a female artist to show a nude man and woman together, and not merely any man or woman, but the artist and her lover (albeit in the guise of religious art). As Hewitt writes, “For a woman to paint a nude heterosexual couple showed extraordinary daring; it was simply not done.” The piece was audacious on a personal level too. The figures poised on the precipice of sin, with Eve/Valadon reaching for the apple, their naked bodies already entwined. Valadon may be referencing her own relationship here - that of an older woman and much younger man - he as the forbidden fruit, and she, with the confidence to take him.'
